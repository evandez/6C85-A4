		<h2>Proposition: Climate change is increasing the rate of natural disasters across the
			world.</h2>

		<section>
			<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="./figures/persuasive.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Number of flood disasters across all countries and average sea level increase
					(measured by NOAA) over time. As sea levels rise, floods are becoming
					significantly more frequent.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(-.5) <b>Subset of data:</b>I focused on flood natural disasters over other
					natural
					disasters because I noticed during my exploratory analysis that the most
					profound change in natural disasters over time has been with floods: they've
					become significantly more frequent in the past twenty years, especially in
					heavily coastal countries. I felt this was a tad deceptive as other disasters
					have not increased in frequency quite as much, though they <i>have</i>
					increased. I opted to include the sea level indicators alongside the natural
					disaster indicators to tie the figure back to global warming; I felt that
					readers more strongly associated sea levels with global warming.
				</li>
				<li>(+1) <b>Shape:</b> I chose to use an area plot for an affective appeal to
					"rising waters." I wanted readers to feel a sense of urgency when looking at
					both the increase in sea level and flood disasters. Initially, I
					considered using a quieter visual representation (e.g. bars) for the flood
					counts, but decided against it because it added visual noise and drew too much
					attention to specific years, when I wanted readers to focus most on the overall
					trend of "rising" values.</li>
				<li>(-1) <b>Selecting the axis ranges:</b> I intentionally restricted the y axis for
					sea level to positive values, hiding the fact that sea levels decreased prior to
					the mid
					1990s and the fact that floods were becoming more common even prior to sea
					levels starting
					to rise. I wanted readers to not get distracted by the negative values and
					to focus mostly on the affective experience of rising waters.</li>
				<li>(1.5) <b>Data transformations:</b> I chose to keep each measurement in terms of
					absolute counts rather than reporting fractions or percentages. The main data
					transformations I performed were averaging the sea level
					changes for each year, normalizing out the different measuring equipment used by
					NOAA
					and the different seas, and joining the sea level measurements with the flood
					disaster
					counts (summed over countries).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="./figures/deceptive.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Average number of natural disasters per country per year in the top-50 countries
					experiencing the greatest surface temperature increases. The red line represents
					the average surface temperature increases in these countries.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(-2) <b>Data selection:</b> Perhaps the most deceptive thing I did in this
					plot
					was to join the natural disaster count indicators with the surface temperature
					indicators, and <i>use this to filter the data down in a seemingly principled
						way</i>. Specifically, I noticed two trends in the data before making the
					plot:
					(1) floods made up most of the increase in natural disasters, and (2) the
					countries that had the greatest increases in temperatures also had the smallest
					increase in floods over the years. Based on this observation, I decided to focus
					the plot on the
					relationship between surface temperature (literal "global warming") with natural
					disaster frequency, and could thus justify filtering the dataset to only the 50
					countries experiencing the most warming. I included all natural disasters in the
					count to help smooth out the bars, resulting bars for natural
					disasters look quite flat, even when you ignore the small axis ranges I describe
					below.</li>
				<li>(1) <b>Data transformation:</b> All of the values plotted in this figure are
					five-year moving averages, intended to denoise the plot a bit. I initially tried
					to make my visualizations without this transformation, but they were too noisy
					to interpret, even though the same trends appeared. I communciated this openly
					in labels of the plot.</li>
				<li>(-1) <b>Axis ranges:</b> I shrunk the natural disaster axis range primarily to
					make the red line more visible, but also to make the natural disaster bars look
					smaller and more benign. Part of the reason I do not label this more deceptive
					is
					that I want to call the most attention to the rising temperatures, while the
					bars
					themselves are (intentionally) flat even scaled up.</li>
				<li>(.5) <b>Labeling, colors, etc.:</b> I made an effort for this figure to feel
					scientific and legitimate, labeling each axis with an exact description of the
					value
					and with the units in parentheses. I chose a deep, warm color for the
					temperature line
					to nod to "warming" (and to make it feel like a legitimate issue!), while also
					choosing
					a soft green color for the bars to suggest "nothing to see here."</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

			<p>Looking back at these two designs, by far the hardest part was identifying what story
				to tell. When it comes to climate data, things often look bleak; it's very hard
				<i>not</i>
				to show increasing trends in metrics like natural disaster counts or temperature. I
				ultimately
				found myself performing a lot of exploratory data analysis in this project, trying
				to tease
				apart the relationships between different climate indicators and the other variables
				(country, year, etc.)
				in the dataset. Once I had identified the relationship between floods the
				total natural disaster
				counts, however, it became a lot easier to reason about the data, and the remaining
				aspects of my designs fell into place. From there, it was straightforward to decide
				what to filter, what metrics to average versus show counts for, what colors to use,
				and so on, because I had discovered the underlying pattern I wanted to use and the I
				knew how I wanted the reader to <i>feel</i> when looking at the visualizations. I
				leaned
				in as heavily as I could to the affective aspect of the design, while preserving
				some
				amount of scientific integrity by using fairly standard methods of data aggregation
				and fairly honest axis labels.
			</p>
			<p>
				At multiple points during the design process, I found myself looking for data
				transformations
				that helped to tell my story. Once particular instance of this was using the
				five-year moving
				averages in the "against" figure: though it does not dramatically change the
				conclusion of the
				figure, it makes the conclusion feel more "absolute." Connecting this back to the
				idea of
				ethical data analysis, some part of performing these transformations feels wrong,
				because you
				as the designer are, to some extent, fishing for a story where there might not be
				one. On the
				other hand, visualizations are designed to communicate, and I think there's a fair
				framing of
				these kinds of data transformations as "denoising" to better present the signal.
				I think the key boundaries depend on how transparent you are with yourself and with
				your audience. It's okay and necessary to augment data, to exclude data, and to mold
				it in order to tell a better story, so long as you're aware of what you're doing and
				honest about it. I think it becomes distinctly unethical when you see the true trend
				and try to hide it.
			</p>
			<p>
				To conclude, I've left this project feeling that the boundary between persuasive and
				deceptive techniques is extremely narrow, and that it depends highly on the
				mission.
				One must ask, as a designer: Am I setting out to discover the truth and persuade
				people of it, or am I setting out to persuade people of my beliefs? And
				consequently,
				one must also ask <i>as a reader</i>: what is the designer's objective in showing me
				this visualization--to bring me to their worldview or to work with me to discover
				the truth?
